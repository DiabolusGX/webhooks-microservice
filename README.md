### Getting Started

This reposetory only contains backend (with express) with webhooks service (with molecular) so using postman will he helpful for managing resuests and responses from backend.

#### Requirements

This module requires the following modules:

 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Installation

To clone the backend and serve it locally, where `MY-WEBHOOKS-MICROSERVICES` is the name of your new repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DiabolusGX/webhooks-microservice.git MY-WEBHOOKS-MICROSERVICES
$ cd MY-WEBHOOKS-MICROSERVICES
```

This will take you to the clonned project directory and ready to configure the project.

#### Configuration

* You have to add `.env` in root directory of the project where you can store all secret keys (like `MONGO_URI` in our case)

  ```shell
  PORT=3000
  SESSION_SECRET=myBigSecretIsHere
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]
  ```
  `PORT` is set to `3000` by default but you MUST enter valid [`MONGO_URI`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) (either mongo atlas cluster or localhost) for application to start and work properly.

  > If the username or password includes the `: / ? # [ ] @` characters, 
  > those characters must be converted using [percent encoding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).

* After you've setup enviornment variables, you can continue with installing dependencies :
  
  - Run to install all rependencies.
    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```
  - Run to start the development server that'll run on `PORT` mentioned in `.env` file (or 3000 be default).
    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```
  - **OR** you an alternatively use `yarn serve` that'll install dependencies and run the server.

* If you're planning to deploy the backend, add 
  ```shell
  NODE_ENV=production
  ```
  to command OR in `.env` file, that'll add extra securty option and will only accept requests from secure sockets (https).

### Routes


Here is list of routes for reference and usability :

#### User
User routes has base `user/` path like login path will be `http://localhost:3000/user/login` with POST method containing credentials (username, password) in JSON format in request body.

| Route     	| Method   	| Data in   	| Requirement 	| Format                                          	|

#### Webhook
